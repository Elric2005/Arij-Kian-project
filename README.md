Our project simulates a war-torn enviroment, in which two players work together to complete riddles (assigned by index to each player). 
The answers are game objects in the enviroment. We seek to raise awareness for deforestation, radiation, and soil erosion through an interactive experience
that places players in the middle of an enviroment similar to recent geopolitical conflicted areas. 
 
 After pulling and then building/running the most recent build of the project,
 you will be spawned in the first scene, where you choose to be host/client.
 After that, you and your partner will be spawned in the second scene. In it,
 your goal is to answer eight riddles (four for the host and four for the client),
 the answers being eight game objects scattered throughout the game world.
 Once all eight are completed, you should be transported to the third scene,
 which is a lush and restored enviroment. The final riddle will be in relation to
 the fountain you're spawned at, and to end the game both players must point at it.
 From there, you're transitioned to the fourth and
 final scene, in which you can choose to restart.
